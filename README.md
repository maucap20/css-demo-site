This application is a revised version of a Coding Challenge presented in unit one. Within the code, you will find changes made to the original that include specific HTML Semantic Elements as well as some minor css styling changes to maintain the desired look of the deployed page. Below is a screenshot (to the best of my ability) of the entire deployed site, as well as a path to the site underneath.
